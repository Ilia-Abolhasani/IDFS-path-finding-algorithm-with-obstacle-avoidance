# IDFS Path Finder with GUI (C#)

This project provides an implementation of the Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) algorithm in C#. It aims to find the shortest path between a source and destination while avoiding obstacles, featuring a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ilia-Abolhasani/idfs-path-finder.git
```

2. Open the solution file (`IDFSPathFinder.sln`) in your preferred IDE.

3. Build the solution to compile the code.

4. Customize the `Map` class to define the map layout, source, destination, and obstacles.

5. Run the program to launch the GUI.

6. Use the GUI to interactively find the shortest path. You can set the source, destination, add obstacles, and visualize the path.
